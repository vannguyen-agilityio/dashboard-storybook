## Build Tools

 - Yeoman 1.0:
	Comprised of three tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a web app: yo (the scaffolding tool), grunt (the build tool) and bower (for package management).
		+ Yo scaffolds out a new application, writing your Grunt configuration and pulling in relevant Grunt tasks that you might need for your build.
		+ Grunt is used to build, preview and test your project, thanks to help from tasks curated by the Yeoman team and grunt-contrib.
		+ Bower is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download and manage your scripts.
	Installation: 
		Please see the link http://yeoman.io for more detail.
